      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // person2 = person
      // console.log(person2)
      // person["age"] = 99
      // console.log(person2)
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99})
      console.log(person)
      console.log(person2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
